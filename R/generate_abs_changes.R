#' Generate Absolute Changes
#'
#' This function simulates an experiment by making
#' changes to absolute copy numbers, using different
#' probabilities of differential expression, of 
#' direction of change, and of what level of differential
#' expression. It returns the copy numbers, relative TPMs,
#' the real fold changes and perceived fold changes of the
#' relative TPMs, as well as the consistency of these two
#' fold changes. NOTE: this only supports two condition
#' experiments at this time.
#'
#' @param tpms a vector of length equal to the number of targets.
#'   preferably named so that the results are tied to target names.
#' @param de_prob a single value greater than 0 and less than 1 to
#'   denote the probability of an individual target having differential
#'   expression
#' @param dir_prob a single value greater than 0 and less than 1 to
#'   denote the probability of the differential expression being increased.
#' @param de_levels a numeric vector of the different possible levels of
#'   differential expression (default has three: a "small" change of 25%,
#'   a moderate change of 100% / 2-fold, and a "large" change of 300% / 4-fold
#' @param seed what the seed is for the random number generator, so that
#'   the results are reproducible
#' @param num_reps an integer vector describing the number of replicates 
#'   each condition will have.
#' 
#' @return a list with the following members:
#'   + abs_fold_changes: a vector of the absolute fold changes for each target
#'   + rel_fold_changes: a vector of the perceived relative fold changes
#'     for each target
#'   + consistent_changes: the consistency of fold changes as determined by
#'     \link{calculate_consistency}
#'   + copy_numbers_per_cell: an N x 2 matrix of the expected copy numbers
#'     for each target in each condition
#'   + transcript_abundances: an N x 2 matrix of the expected relative TPMs
#'     for each target in each condition
