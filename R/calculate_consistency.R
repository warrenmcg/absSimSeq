#' Calculate Consistency of Relative vs Absolute Changes
#'
#' If the assumption holds true that the overall
#' composition of (and the total amount of) RNA in each 
#' sample is the same, then the absolute and relative fold
#' changes should agree. If the assumption is violated,
#' then they will not agree. This function compares the 
#' absolute fold change and the perceived fold change
#' of the proportions of each target in a collection. It
#' reports a summary of how many targets were consistent
#' and how many were inconsistent. It also summarizes the
#' kind of consistency or inconsistency.
#'
#' @param fold_changes a vector of absolute fold changes
#' @param relative_fc a vector of perceived relative fold changes
#' @param log_scale if \code{TRUE} (default is \code{FALSE}),
#'   the fold_changes are on the log scale (i.e. 0 is no change);
#'   otherwise the fold_changes are on the absolute scale (i.e. 1
#'   is no change).
#' 
#' @return a factor vector listing the consistency for each target.
#'   the possible levels are "zeroCNs" (zero copy numbers),
#'   "consistent_noChange", "consistent_change", "zero2change"
#'   (an absolute 'no change' is perceived as a relative change),
#'   "change2zero" (an absolute change is perceived as not changing),
#'   "down2up" (an absolute decrease is perceived as a relative increase),
#'   or "up2down" (an absolute increase is perceived as a relative decrease)
