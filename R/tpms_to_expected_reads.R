#' Convert TPMs to Expected Fragments
#' 
#' This function takes as input a matrix of transcript abundances
#' (in TPMs) and converts them to expected fragments for each
#' transcript in each condition. The expected reads is proportional
#' to the effective length for the transcript and the expected size
#' of the library.
#'
#' @param trans_abund, a N x 2 matrix or data frame of transcript
#'   abundances (in TPMs) for each transcript in each of two conditions.
#' @param eff_lens, a vector of effective lengths for each transcript.
#'   the transcripts must be in the same order as what is found in
#'   \code{trans_abund}.
#' @param mean_library_size, a single value of the expected size of the
#'   sequencing library (e.g. 60 million fragments)
#' 
#' @return a list with two entries:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item expected_reads: an N x 2 matrix of the expected reads for each
#'       transcript in each condition
#'     \item fold_changes: the perceived fold changes if one were to use the
#'       expected reads (unnormalized by library size or transcript effective
#'       length).
#'   }
