# absSimSeq

Simulate RNA-Seq experiments with an explicit definition of the 
absolute RNA counts.

This package extends the [`polyester`](https://github.com/alyssafrazee/polyester)
package by simulating an RNA-Seq using absolute RNA counts before
converting the result into relative proportions (in TPMs and expected
fragments) that are then used as input for `polyester`.
